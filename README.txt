Football Position Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains the code to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and locate the position of a football in images. The model is trained on the given training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to replicate the results using PyCharm:

Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyCharm (or any Python IDE of your choice)
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, keras

Installation
1. Clone this repository ( https://github.com/Danmallan/footballDetection ) to your local machine.
2. Open the cloned repository in PyCharm.

Data Preparation
1. Download the dataset(soccer_exercise) through this link: [Dataset]( https://github.com/Danmallan/footballDetection) and unzip it.

Running the Code
1. Open the `main.py` file in PyCharm.
3. Run the `main.py` script.

The code will train the CNN model, evaluate its accuracy on the test dataset, and plot the accuracy over epochs.

Results
After running the code, you will see the training progress and the final test accuracy printed in the console. Additionally, a plot showing the training and validation accuracy over epochs will be displayed.
